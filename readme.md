Mercury is a set of utilities to build API connectors in a breeze. (WIP)

## The why

As a developer tasked with pulling third-party API data and integrating it into applications, I have found 
that not all APIs are created equal. The sea of subtle differences and methods that
you have to brawl against when integrating is the reason why Mercury was created. Although different, most APIs
respect (or at least try) some common concepts, and the fact that a one-size-fits-all approach is not achievable is
 the core ideology behind what Mercury tries to overcome.

 ## The how

 Mercury consists of 3 core parts: **Authenticate**, **Gather** and **Stream**. Each of these parts is
 a collection of highly flexible and composable utility functions that will provide you a
 common and simple way of consuming most of the concepts that won't common code away.

 
## Authenticate

Common structure for describing, consuming, validating and refreshing credentials
from third-party APIs.

#### Reference

 *work in progress*
## Gather

Functions for consuming pagination, overcoming rate limits and quotas, requesting large datasets in a memory-efficient manner.

#### Reference

 *work in progress*
## Stream

Simple utilities to harness the power of NodeJS Streams in the context of pulling, transforming and pushing data from APIs.
